## This is the input card to copy all necessary input root files to calculate htt limits for SM and MSSM 
## into the local copy of the cvs HiggsAnalysis/HiggsToTauTau package. These files can not be stored in
## the repository directly due to size limitations in official CMSSW cvs repositories. To be able to use 
## the automatic datacard creation described in the README file of the setup directory in this package 
## this inputcard should be checked and modified accordingly (if necessary) or the inputfiles should be 
## copied into the corresponding sub-directory in setup by hand.
