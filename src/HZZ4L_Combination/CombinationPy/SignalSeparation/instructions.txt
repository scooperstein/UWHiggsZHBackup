Instructions for running the signal separation with Lands and combine
using the scripts in UserCode/HZZ4L_Combination/CombinationPy/SignalSeparation/


First of all, you must have created 2D templates (AnalysisInputs/generateTemplates.C) 
and cards specific for the hypothesis testing (see instructions
in CreateDatacards/README ).


---------------------
--- for LandS -------

1) open the file execute_SignalSeparationLandS.sh and set the variables MH, NJOBS and NTOYS

2) copy here the directoryes with the cards and ws for LandS previously generated

3) merge cards with combineCards.py
combineCards.py hzz4l_2e2muS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4eS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4muS_8TeV.txt > hzz4l_4lS_8TeV.txt
combineCards.py hzz4l_2e2muS_8TeV_ALT.txt hzz4l_4eS_8TeV_ALT.txt hzz4l_4muS_8TeV_ALT.txt > hzz4l_4lS_8TeV_ALT.txt

4) #Step 1: generate toys
./execute_SignalSeparationLandS.sh <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/ hzz4l_4lS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4lS_8TeV_ALT.txt 1

It will submit NJOBS*2 parallel jobs (one for the SM and the other for the PS hypothesis).
Wait that the jobs on the queue are finished.
Note 1:You can set the batch queue inside runSignalSeparation.py


5) #Step 2: fit toys
./execute_SignalSeparationLandS.sh <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/ hzz4l_4lS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4lS_8TeV_ALT.txt 2

It will submit NJOBS*4 parallel jobs
Again, wait for all the jobs to be finished.

6)#Step 3: plot variables
./execute_SignalSeparationLandS.sh <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/ hzz4l_4lS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4lS_8TeV_ALT.txt 3

Note: there are several options for steering the main macro called runSignalSeparation.py
Refer to the file README in this same directory for more details about them



-------------------
--- for combine ---


1) open the file execute_SignalSeparationCombine.sh and set the variables MH and NTOYS ;


2) copy here the directories with the cards and ws for LandS previously generated

3) merge cards with combineCards.py
combineCards.py hzz4l_2e2muS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4eS_8TeV.txt hzz4l_4muS_8TeV.txt > hzz4l_4lS_8TeV.txt
combineCards.py hzz4l_2e2muS_8TeV_ALT.txt hzz4l_4eS_8TeV_ALT.txt hzz4l_4muS_8TeV_ALT.txt > hzz4l_4lS_8TeV_ALT.txt

4) run the script choosing what type of analysis you want to do (fixed mu, floating mu, 2D scan)
./execute_SignalSeparationCombine.sh <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/ hzz4l_4lS_8TeV_ALT.txt <action can be 1 or 2 or 3>

5) when it's done,  the output will be called qmu.root in <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/
cp extractSignificanceStats.C <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/
cd <dir_with_cards>/HCG/<mass>/
### you must compile the macro, otherwise it won't make it
root -b
.L extractSignificanceStats.C++
extractSignificanceStats()
