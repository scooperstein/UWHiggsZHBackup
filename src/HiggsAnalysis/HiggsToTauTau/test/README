In order to run the postfit plots, go to produce_macros.py:

This script will create the macros for each channel and category that can be run to produce the postfit plots.
produce_macros.py works from a template macro (see the templates/) directory and inserts a line to scale the histogram according to the fit results and the datacard. In order to calculate this weight, produce_macros parses the datacard to get the value of the +1 sigma variation and parses the fit result file to get the number of sigma variations of the parameter in the best-fit result. The weight applied to a histogram is then computed as \sum_i{1+uncert_i*sigma_var_i}, where i is an index ranging over all fit parameters tfor which some uncertainty applies to the yield in the current category and sample.

After producing the macro (it should appear in your home directory), you can run all macros and produce all plots with the run_macros python script. It is important to use this script, which enters and re-exits root after executing each macro due to scoping issues and the similar structure of the macros for the different channels.

The following should run right away:

cvs up . # gets the templates/ directory of template macros, the fitresults directory, and the necessary python scripts
python produce_macros.py
python run_macros.py
